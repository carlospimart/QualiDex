<span>Photography<br>Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light,<br>either electronically by means of an image sensors, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive<br>material such as photographic film. It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing<br>(e.g., photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video<br>production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication.</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">[</del><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">1</del><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">]</del><span><br>Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real images<br>on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic image<br>sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and<br>stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. The result with photographic<br>emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically "developed" into a visible image,<br>either negative or positive depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"><br>of </del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> of<br></ins><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"><br>of </del><span>processing.
